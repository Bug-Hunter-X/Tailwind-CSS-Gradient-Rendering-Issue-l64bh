# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where a Tailwind CSS gradient doesn't render correctly in certain situations.  The issue may arise from browser compatibility or CSS conflicts.

## Bug Description

The `bg-gradient-to-r` utility is used to create a linear gradient background. In some instances, however, the gradient is not applied, is partially applied, or displays incorrect colors. This can depend on the browser being used and the presence of conflicting styles.

## Solution

The solution involves using more specific selectors or adding fallback styles to ensure gradient compatibility across different browsers.  Also check for conflicting CSS rules that may be overriding your gradient styles.
