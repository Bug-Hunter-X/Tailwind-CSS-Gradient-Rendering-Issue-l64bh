```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient functionality, but sometimes the gradient might not render correctly. This can happen if the browser doesn't fully support the `linear-gradient` function or if there's a conflict with other CSS rules.
